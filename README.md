# Amazon-Clone
Amazon-inspired e-commerce website built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON. This project features a functional shopping cart, and interactive UI elements that simulate a real online shopping experience. Designed to showcase front-end skills, it uses JSON as a mock database and JavaScript for DOM manipulation and interactivity.
